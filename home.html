        <h1>Development</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
            <p>This is a project for CS1300: User Interface and Experience at Brown University, in which I create a list interface using React. </p>
            <p>I opted to create a website for a dessert shop, Jeff's Dessert Shop, where users can sort the products by price as well as filter products by type and flavor. Users can 
                also add and remove items from their cart. 
            </p>
        <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>I designed my application with the following goals and values in mind:</p>

            <h3>Goals:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The application should be intuitive and easy to use.</li>
                <li>The application should be visually pleasing and effectively appeal to potential dessert buyers.</li>
                <li>The application effectively display all the information that a buyer may need before making a purchase (e.g. price of each item, total price, etc.).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Values:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Users should view this application as an easy and convenient way to make dessert purchases.</li>
                <li>The purchase process should be usable and memorable enough for users to want to come back to make another purchase.</li>
                <li>Users should enjoy the process of browsing through the products and making their choices for purchase.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In order to achieve these goals and values, I designed the application with the following usability principles in mind:</p>

            <h2>Usability Principles:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Learnability: </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Upon first use, I wanted users to be able to know exactly where to click to do a certain task. Particularly, I made the function of each button clear, such as the "Add 1 to cart" button for 
                    each item. This button makes it clear that upon clicking, exactly 1 item will be added to the cart. Same goes for the "Remove 1 from cart" buttons. As for filtering and sorting, I chose radio buttons
                    because they are generally universally accepted as selection tools, instead of buttons, which may indicate that clicking it will navigate to another page, which is not what I wanted users to be confused about.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </li>
                <li><b>Efficiency: </b> 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I wanted users to be able to quickly do whatever task they set out to do on this application. Therefore, the filtering options would make it easier for users to 
                see specific products, based on flavor and type. Also, I chose my sorting feature to sort by price because when buying items, customers typically use this option, as price is a major consideration in 
            purchases. Overall, I chose my filtering and sorting options based on what I thought users would want to use and thus make their experience more efficient.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                 </li>
            <li><b>Memorability: </b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I wanted users to be able to remember how to use this application if they ever came back to use it in the future. Therefore, I decided to include a sidebar, which consolidiated all the 
                        filtering and sorting functionality in one place. This way, users do not have to think about where they had to go to sort or filter by a certain value. Also, the sidebar also includes the cart.
                        In general, having the sidebar contain everything besides the main page displaying the products makes it easier for users to rememer where to go to do a certain task.
                    
                    </li>
                </ul> </li>
            </ul>
